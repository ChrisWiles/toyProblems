#### Description:

You have to search all numbers from inclusive 1 to inclusive a given number x, that have the given digit d in it.  
The value of d will always be 0 - 9.  
The value of x will always be greater than 0.

You have to return as an array  

## the count of these numbers,  

## their sum   

## and their product.  


For example:  

	x = 11
	d = 1
	->
	Numbers: 1, 10, 11
	Return: [3, 22, 110]


If there are no numbers, which include the digit, return [0,0,0].   

Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)   

I have created other katas. Have a look if you like coding and challenges.
