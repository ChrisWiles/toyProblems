## Island Count

##

Given a string representation of a 2d map, return the number of islands in the map. Land spaces are denoted by a zero, while water is denoted by a dot. Two land spaces are considered connected if they are adjacent (but not diagonal).

(!!!) NOTICE: Newline characters in the inputs have been replaced with &lt;br /&gt; tags to make the value easier to read. In other words, when you see a break, it's actually a

\ncharacter. Check your console when submitting to see the input for yourself.
