## Coin Sums

In England the currency is made up of pound, £, and pence, p, and there are eight coins in general circulation:

1p
2p
5p
10p
20p
50p
£1 (100p)
£2 (200p)

Given a given number of pence, return the possible number of ways someone could make change.

It is possible to make 5 pence in the following ways:

5 * 1p

3 * 1p + 1 * 2p

1 * 1p + 2 * 2p

1 * 5p

In other words, find all the possible combinations of coins that sum to a given pence value.
