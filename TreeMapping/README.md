## Tree Mapping

##

Implement a 

map method on this Tree class.

Map accepts a mapping function as its only argument. It traverses the tree, passing each node’s value into the mapping function, and generates a new tree containing the results.

So 

map should return a tree with the same structure, and different values, but it should NOT modify the tree that was passed in.
